# Job-Task-Analysis

As part of my research I analyzed ONET's Task Statements dataset to see if there was a correlation over time and the advancement of technology and if there was a clear increase trend in jobs that require Research and Data Science tasks using frequency analysis, descriptive statistics, and natural language processing using Hugging Face's pretrained one shot classifier to categorize data. I wished I would be able to make one myself but I did not have the training data to do so.

Project still on going, expected tomorrow
